# Music Theory Query
MU SWDV691 Connor Simmons' Capstone Project - Music Theory Query

Music Theory Query was my capstone project at Maryville University. We were tasked with developing a dynamic web application with a database connection and abstracted services. Music Theory Query is a simple music theory practice resource which stores resources as images in the database and allows the user to pick and choose which they would like to see. Additionally, users who set up an account may store resources on a customizable home page/dashboard for quick reference or targeted practice. The application is built largely in PHP with HTML and CSS. Security is minimal as it was not a graded criteria, instead I focused on delivering the minimum viable product outlined early in the semester.
