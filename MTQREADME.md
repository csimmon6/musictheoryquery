# Music Theory Query
MU SWDV691 Connor Simmons' Capstone Project - Music Theory Query

Music Theory Query is an interactive and customizable music theory learning resource. It will make use of a variety of resources and references, interactive tools, and the ability to customize a home page with practice material. MTQ works from a database of practice resources which a user may pull to view at their discretion. Users who create an account will are able to add these resources to a table in the db which loads into their home page. In other words users may take practice resources they would like to have available for quick reference and add them to their home page. This will allow for simultaneous use of practice references, after which the resources may be removed and replaced.
