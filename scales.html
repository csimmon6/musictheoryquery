            <p>Scales are like a pattern of notes that are played in a given key. Put very simply, keys are like groups of notes and chords that can sound good together. If you play 
            in one key and add notes from outside of that key, those notes will sound out of place. Finding notes in a major key is a simple as following a pattern: whole, 
            whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half.</p>
            
            <p>Whole and half refer to steps (also called tones). Using a piano for example, a half step is moving from one key to the next one 
            (left or right and including black and white keys) and a whole step is moving two keys. On string instruments with frets, like a guitar, a half step is moving one fret 
            up or down on the same string, and a whole step is two frets.</p>

            <p>Below you can see this pattern put into practice. You can use the drop down list to see the pattern in different keys, the only difference is the note that you start on. 
            For example, if you choose the key of C the pattern (W, W, H, W, W, W, H) begins on the note C.</p>
