# Services Project
MU SWDV691 Connor Simmons Capstone Project - Music Theory Query - Services project
The Services project contains tasks related to the underlying services of Music Theory Query. This includes the API, database updating functions, and database querying functions.

This application will allow user to create accounts and customize the homepage interface to suit their needs. To that end, services largely concern querying the database to retrieve or move resources at the user's discretion. Also included are services allowing for account handling. Users may create an account which is stored in the database, login to their account, which runs a check against the database before storing a session variable, and logout, which resets the session variable.
